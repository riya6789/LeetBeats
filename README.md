**A Chrome extension that celebrates your LeetCode wins with confetti and a fun meme**

LeetBeats is a Chrome extension designed to make coding on LeetCode as fun as it is challenging. Developed in vanilla JavaScript, LeetBeats celebrates your successful submissions with vibrant confetti and playful memes, turning every hard-earned 'Accepted' into a moment of joy. And for those tricky questions that donâ€™t quite land, the extension plays a humorous audio track to add a touch of levity and keep frustration at bay. By bringing energy, humor, and celebration into coding practice, LeetBeats turns each LeetCode session into an interactive, motivating experience that keeps you coming back for more.
